ACTIVITY 1 :
Download data for last 1 years for a set of the any five stock tickers belonging to the same

another similar source.

ACTIVITY 2 :
Calculate Monthly returns of downloaded stock over the period under study

ACTIVITY 3 :
Using a combination function, calculate the monthly returns of an equally weighted portfolio
consisting of any 3 of the five stocks in question

ACTIVITY 4 :
Graphically represent the cumulative monthly returns of each of the possible portfolios through
line plots

ACTIVITY 5 :
Calculate mean, median and standard deviation of monthly values for each of the portfolios in
question and plot them on the same graph mentioned in step 4.

ACTIVITY 6 :
Calculate the overall variance of all portfolio returns

ANALYSIS OF RESULTS

1. How are the monthly returns of possible portfolios distributed?
I have worked on 1.Goldman Sachs(GS) 2. Morgan Stanley(MS) 3. Citigroup(C) 4. Wells Fargo
Securities(WFC) 5. JP Morgan Chase(JPM) – All belong to Investment Banking sector at US. Out of
five stocks, only three stocks has been selected, thus has total 10 portfolio combinations. Distribution
of monthly return of different portfolios have been compared below :
Portfolio 8 (MS, C, JPM), 3 (GS, MS, JPM) and 5 (GS, C, JPM) have given best monthly return having
annual average return as 0.05624781 , 0.04524429 , 0.04490376, when weight of each stock
investment kept equal. There is high co-relation between trend of each of the portfolio.

2. Do you see a wide variance in the possible portfolio returns and its cumulative outcome?
Yes, there is wide variance in possible portfolio return and cumulative outcome. Below given graph
show it explicitely.
Meanwhile, standard deviation of each of the portfolio shows very less variation in comparision of each
other.

3. Given that you chose similar stocks from the same industry, what accounts for the variance
of returns among different portfolios (if any)?
If I have chosen similar stocks from the same industry, the account for variance of return among different
portfolio will be due to following reasons :
1. Selection of stock in portfolio which is either giving a very high or very low return.
2. Weight of investment of different stock to create a portfolio
3. Co-variance of stocks of one company with other.
4. Performance of an underlying company and its management for company growth.
5. Change in policy of government in course of time.
6. Economic parameters affecting fundamentals of the company, etc.
